2020-05-06 18:36:27+00:00,     I bet you also dont know that about 1/3rd of women have had an abortion. And miscarriage is so common that its pretty much assumed that most sexually active women have had one.
2020-05-06 18:35:24+00:00,     For instance Im willing to be that you dont know that abortion is simply the medical term for ending a pregnancy and is also used to refer to miscarriages.
2020-05-06 18:34:35+00:00,     The entirety of your argument is that abortions are wrong which is based solely on YOUR feeling rather than science and you lack any understanding of what Abortion really means.
2020-05-06 18:31:24+00:00,     My decision to have or not have an abortion does not have any greater societal effects no. Its my personal choice and it effects no one except me.
2020-05-06 18:27:01+00:00,     Abortion is very much a womans issue and frankly its none of your business.

2020-05-06 18:03:17+00:00,     Abortion is an incredibly complex issue. The fact the you think it is simple once again speaks to your lack of understanding of the issue.
2020-05-06 17:18:56+00:00,     Most importantly though... no woman WANTS to have an abortion. It is a PAINFUL INVASIVE procedure. Even the abortion pill is PAINFUL. You experience contractions as a woman in child birth would. Women get abortions out of necessity.
2020-05-06 17:17:08+00:00,"     1. If you dont believe in abortion dont get one. 
2. You dont get to decide at what point a womans life is in danger. 
3. Birth Control is not 100% effective and its failure should not sentence a woman to have to go through with pregnancy and child birth."
2020-05-06 17:05:55+00:00,     Humans by definition have brain stems and can breathe on their own. When abortion occurs it is nothing more than a cluster of cells with the potential to become human. We dont refer to seeds as oranges do we?

2020-04-24 00:18:03+00:00,Im not say abortion should be praised and normalized but its no ones business what women do with their bodies! Protesting against it while outside of a clinic should be illegal.

2019-05-16 16:13:52+00:00,   But you know this was bound to happen. Im starting to come to terms with it even though I hate it. If Im ever raped and become pregnant I would probably get an abortion. People say Im going to hell because of it. Funny. Im already going to hell bu their standards.
2019-05-16 16:04:38+00:00, Georgias law states that once a heartbeat is detected (5-6 weeks) abortion is illegal and is considered a FELONY. Most women dont even realize theyre pregnant at 6 weeks

2019-05-16 15:48:06+00:00,"The truth is that an abortion ban does more than strip women of their medical rights, it stigmatizes womens sexuality and creates negative connotations around womens reproductive health by placing misogynistic ideologies on it."
2019-05-16 15:47:17+00:00,"The truth is that the criminalization of abortion does not end abortion, with 25 million unsafe abortions taking place each year."
2019-05-16 15:45:28+00:00,The truth is that 75% of abortion patients are low-income and the criminalization of abortion will increase that demographics likelihood of remaining low-income.
2019-05-16 15:45:10+00:00,Not going to write a think piece (today) on the abortion ban but I just wanted to drop some truths on the topic: the truth is that 1 in 4 pregnancies end in abortion which by logic means that ~1 in 4 men are affected by abortion. (A thread...)
2019-05-16 15:11:51+00:00,Remember that the term pro-life is a misnomer and synonym for anti-abortion movements only. Growing up in catholic school they were very explicit about this. It has nothing to do with life of any kind outside the womb.
