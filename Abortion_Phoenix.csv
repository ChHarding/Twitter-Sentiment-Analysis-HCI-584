2022-06-24 06:46:02+00:00,  It does really hurt that the court can be bought so to speak. We will fight to get House and Senate sufficient majority to codify abortion.
2022-06-24 03:21:25+00:00, This isn't really about abortion. This is about radicalize insurrectionists forcing us to accept a radicalized religion and definition of what a life is based on their religion. Your First Amendment right to choose what faith you believe in will be thrown out in favor of theirs.
2022-06-24 03:11:25+00:00,  Soon what they all have in common will be enough money to get abortion illegal or not

2022-06-23 15:07:04+00:00,     Youre imposing your value judgement that contravenes what medical science has established 2B  fact that abortion performed within proscribed guidelines is not in any way murder.

2022-06-20 22:45:08+00:00,"   I did google it and nothing comes up because its a lie. Lmao. If a fetus can try to get away from abortion instruments, how to doctors perform amniocentesis and accidentally hit the fetus. Does it just know one instrument is different than the other?

2022-06-20 20:46:53+00:00,   But forcing her to give birth to a child that her body is not physically prepared for and that she most definitely cannot afford helps her? Forcing her to become a mother at 12 is better than allowing her to have an abortion and get the help she needs so she can heal?
2022-06-20 19:50:01+00:00,"   I meant you can mind your own business in general. Like, be against abortion but dont harass women at clinics. I didnt mean you necessarily, I meant a general you."

2022-06-18 18:59:14+00:00,"   Tell me, which form of contraception prevents 100 percent of pregnancies (dont say abstinence b/c thats not contraception)? Furthermore, its none of your business if another human has an abortion. If you dont want one, dont have one. Super simple."
2022-06-18 17:44:16+00:00,   I would NEVER defend throwing ANY human off a building. And I responded to a post about baptists and abortion. I made zero reference to Islam.
2022-06-18 17:16:58+00:00,"  I understood her point. As I pointed out, books for abstinence exist. Therefore, her point that because there are books on abortion there should be books on abstinence is, indeed, moot. "
2022-06-18 17:15:53+00:00,  Thanks for respecting my view. I respect peoples right to view abortion how they want. I do not respect any attempt to limit access to safe abortions.
2022-06-18 16:58:31+00:00,  I wasnt talking about her. She doesnt see a conflict between abortion and faith. A lot of people dont see a conflict.
2022-06-18 15:42:01+00:00," This is MY district. I want to know whos playing. As a refresher, I sent this anti-abortion PRO-DEATH mariachi packing when she showed up trying to pander for our vote "

2022-06-13 11:26:03+00:00,"    Further, abortion was practiced and not illegal from the founding of the US up to the 1800s. Historically, abortion was not outlawed or considered illegal. So, I would argue abortion is more a natural right than voting. Voting wasnt a thing until monarchies started to topple."
2022-06-13 11:20:17+00:00,"    There are species of animals that terminate pregnancy of the male/head of their pack changes. How is owning a gun, voting, getting married, etc a natural right? They are all constructs of man and society. The Bible , if you believe, discusses forcing an abortion."

2019-05-21 14:25:56+00:00,"This is the reality of abortion.  All of the hot button  reasons the left talks about  (health of the mother, etc) are red herrings.  Reality is most abortions are simply buyers remorse.   Sad... "
2019-05-20 23:01:59+00:00,"This is a big part of the solution to anti abortion. So why are anti abortionists against birth control
"
2019-05-20 16:56:41+00:00,Idk why girls mad at guys for this abortion law... yall forget we the first ones to suggest it? We all fucked.
2019-05-20 03:45:25+00:00,"   Then step up with your responsibility. The woman choosing abortion has her reasons on why that is the responsible thing to do for her family. If you support the government making that decision for her, you pick up the tab for that child and the mother during her pregnancy."
2019-05-20 01:23:38+00:00,Change that abortion law 
2019-05-20 01:02:34+00:00,"  And that's how it should be. Cause obviously if it isn't a medical emergency, then it's just a wilful act of abortion. I knew there had to be a loop hole"
2019-05-20 01:00:06+00:00,  I'm really not big on abortion tbh..it would be best for her to give it away once delivered rather than the alternative. But then again ppl go through shit so it's easier said than done
2019-05-20 00:46:59+00:00,"  Wtf...isn't miscarriages an accidental act? Why they going overboard with this? I get the ban on abortion but labeling miscarriages as a criminal offense, that's just absurd"
2019-05-20 00:38:47+00:00,Unbelievable! Abortion is not a form of contraception! 
2019-05-20 00:28:55+00:00,"having an abortion affects the one having it and that is it; but when someone kills someone with a gun, you affect everyone who knew the person killed. theres a difference"
2019-05-19 23:02:56+00:00, So is this the same argument of if you you dont have a utuerus you shouldnt have an opinion on abortion? Cuz GOP responded well to those.... 
2019-05-19 20:16:59+00:00,This is becoming about more than abortion laws at this point. These states are legalizing rape and the right to keep these women captive and campaigning it as pro life so it doesnt sound bad. Get the fuck outta here with that shit.
2019-05-19 18:34:46+00:00,No man have the right to choose whether or not a woman can get an abortion... especially if that said person is a surviving rape victim. To have to bare the trauma of the rape and now bare a child forcibly is truly  preposterous.  
2019-05-19 18:24:36+00:00,Dumb bitches really trying to say abortion is more disgusting or is worse than rape? Yall need a serious reality check. When Carlos knocks u up I doubt youll be going off on how READY u are for a kid as a sophomore in high school lol 
2019-05-19 17:37:34+00:00,"If the US keeps up w this abortion and rape bullshit Im moving to Europe. This country is turning to shit, I will not be a part of it."
2019-05-19 16:55:21+00:00,"Look, imma say it here and Im gonna have to say it again....THIS WHOLE BAN ON ABORTION IS NOT TO PROTECT THE UNBORN, ITS TO FUCKING CONTROL WOMEN!"
2019-05-19 14:18:29+00:00," Yep, thats the big lie.
Lumping abortion with womens healthcare."
2019-05-19 08:31:19+00:00," I wish your mother had been able to see into the future and see the creature to whom she gave birth. If she had access to a legal abortion I know she would have taken advantage of it.  Also, Im sorry you were able to re-spawn."
2019-05-19 05:18:55+00:00,DONT GET PREGNANT.....? ARE YOU DUMB SILLY LIL KIDS ALWAYS GOT THE MOST TO SAY!! STFU PEOPLE HAVE SEX TO HAVE SEX!! YES ACCIDENTS HAPPEN AND MANY PEOPLE ARENT READY. ABORTION ISNT AND NEVER WILL BE MURDER ENGRAVE THAT IN YOUR THICK ASS SKULL. 
2019-05-19 02:11:30+00:00,"Prediction: due to this latest craze of abortion bans, women now rising up, along with guys like me, are going to be even MORE motivated to vote blue, and you bet your ass that we're going to vote Trump's out of the White House, and Mitch's out of the Senate if we can!"
2019-05-19 01:58:54+00:00,"Maybe If we tell them the fetus will be Muslim, gay , transgender , etc theyll let us get the abortion ?"
2019-05-19 01:45:12+00:00,"The person who commented this on my Facebook post was my 4-6th grade teacher at the private school I attended. At that private school, which I attended until high school, I was NEVER taught proper sex education. Only abstinence. She is against abortion, but doesnt support sex ed "

2019-05-18 19:47:45+00:00,"     Actually I believe abortion should stay legal.  
But more than 500,000 are performed every year, so something can change to bring that number down."
2019-05-18 18:18:23+00:00,"This just in: theres no such thing as male privilege, but these abortion bans being passed to control women are all being voted on by... ding ding ding! Youve got it! Mainly old, white men! "
2019-05-18 18:15:51+00:00,"  If men got pregnant instead of women, youd be able to get an abortion at a gas station. Acknowledge your privilege and go."
2019-05-18 18:00:15+00:00," You obviously dont understand what this abortion ban is about, so Im done talking to you. Hopefully you decide to become educated on the matter and understand your privilege as a man. Goodbye."
2019-05-18 17:52:24+00:00,We are discussing the right to an abortion. I have taken birth control everyday for years but you know what can happen? Birth control fails. IUDs can cause serious health implications. Some women dont have access though. Another way you just showed your privilege. 
2019-05-18 17:39:20+00:00,"Actually, in Georgias there is nothing exempting women from being charged for having an abortion. Secondly, by threatening to prosecuted providers, you are taking away a womans ability, therefore impeding on her right. You have 0 idea what this means for women &amp; thats clear. "
2019-05-18 16:51:44+00:00,theory: lawmakers are acting comcerned about abortion but theyre trying to distract us from climate change
2019-05-18 15:51:15+00:00,"  Abortion should stay legal, for those situations you mentioned.
But those arent the most common reasons for abortion.
Bye."
2019-05-18 15:41:06+00:00," If the S.Ct. agrees with Alabama that a fetus cannot be extinguished at the first heart beat, at six weeks gestation, then how could another state legislature allow abortion after that point?  Wouldnt the fetus have a federal constitutional right to compel a delivery to term?"
2019-05-18 14:01:04+00:00,"  Yes!  Thats why you surprised me.  
Making it mandatory, kind of like pro-lifers.   
Btw... My problem with abortion is that so many of them couldve been prevented.  (Just irresponsible sex.)"
2019-05-18 12:41:26+00:00,9 1/2 Weeks Is Too Late For an Abortion in This RIDICULOUS State  
2019-05-18 08:42:36+00:00," Wow, you sound very educated on abortion!"
2019-05-18 07:13:11+00:00,"   Lmao well you do realize thats not how it works, right? Rapists have gotten custody of their children who were created through rape. The repercussions for having an abortion or a doctor giving someone an abortion are more severe than someone who rapes another human."
2019-05-18 05:31:37+00:00,Its a beautiful day to delete people off Facebook who support the Alabama abortion law. Goodbye Hannah &amp; George!
