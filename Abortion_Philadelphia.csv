2018-07-22 13:34:03+00:00,"  But, from what I can gather, goes back long before that - lots of early Church fathers condemned abortion as murder. Later, Augustine and Aquinas had a more moderate approach - pre-quickening abortions were condemned, but were not murder."

2018-07-09 01:55:23+00:00,"   Libertarians believe the government exists to secure the rights of individuals, beginning with the rights of life, liberty, and property. Abortion is a denial of those fundamental and inalienable human rights. Pro-life should be the default libertarian position."

A decision between the woman, her doctor and the God of her choice. She has to live with that. Roe vs Wade forever."
2018-07-06 12:09:43+00:00,"          I believe Roe v Wade emphasizes the rights of the mom early in the pregnancy &amp; on the unborn child after viability. Making it legal for states to place limits of abortion only after 6 mo, w/exceptions in cases of rape/danger to health of the Mom. Its a well balanced decision."

Abortion is not a cure for complications in childbirth. Elective abortion will not lower the amount of women who suffer childbirth complications. Suggesting otherwise is to suggest we abort healthy, wanted pregnancies instead of finding actual solutions."
2018-07-03 20:17:03+00:00," Depending on how you ask the question, you get different responses. Asking about Roe is the way to get the largest number of people favorable to abortion rights. If you ask if people are ""pro-choice"" vs. ""pro-life,"" the number's pretty evenly split, I believe."

2018-07-02 23:37:48+00:00,Incorrect. Outlawing abortion does bring down the number of abortions. To suggest that all women who face unplanned pregnancy will resolve to unsafe abortion shows you have very little faith and respect for the female population

2018-05-29 10:10:22+00:00," How can any one have an abortion is something I'll never understand. I view a fetus as a developing baby in the world waiting to be born and have a life the same as me. If I can have a life, what gives me the right to deny another a life."
2018-05-28 20:28:53+00:00,"I think we have deluded ourselves into believing that people dont know that abortion is killing. So any pretense that abortion is not killing is a signal of our ambivalence, a signal that we cannot say yes, it kills a fetus.
